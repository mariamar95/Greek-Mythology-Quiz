  - ##  **Design**
    -  **Colour Scheme:**
       All the colours used on the website were sourced from the illustration that is used on the background of the quiz.<br>
         - **#F7FBFF** : Off-white used to as background. Covers the parts that the illustration does not cover.<br>
         - **#DEEAF6**: Light blue, used as background colour on some parts of the page like buttons and heading.<br>
         - **#394C70**: Dark blue, used for text and border. <br>
         - **#FEC26A**: Gold yellow, used on text and icons on the website.    
        <br>
     -  **Typography:** The website used 2 fonts <br>
          - **Caesar Dressing**: Used for headings and titles. The font was chosen as it aligns with the website's style which is Greek Mythology.
          - **Magra** : Used for all the rest of the website such as questions and instractions. The Caesar Dressing Font can be hard to read on long pieces of text, that is when the Magra font is used instead.
         <br>
     -   **Imagery** 
          - The illustation used on the background was sourced from [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/home)
